<p>First, we create some custom theme to ensure homogoneity throughout the presentation deck.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># set global theme
# custom theme
bg_color = &quot;#0B0C10&quot;
bar_color = &quot;#66FCF1&quot;
text_main = &quot;#FFFFF&quot;
text_ticks = &quot;#CFC6C7&quot;
axis_lines = #453a3b&quot;
cust_theme &lt;- theme(plot.title = element_text(color = &#39;white&#39;, vjust=0.5, hjust=0.5),
                    plot.background = element_rect(fill = bg_color),
                    panel.background = element_rect(fill = bg_color),
                    axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1),
                    axis.text = element_text(colour = text_ticks),
                    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
                    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
                    panel.grid.major.y =  element_line(colour = &quot;#453a3b&quot;, linetype = 1, size = 0.25),
                    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
                    axis.title = element_text(colour = &quot;white&quot;))

# overwrite default theme with custom
theme_set(theme_foundation() + cust_theme)</code></pre>

<p>Then, we created a relative file path from the “here” library for better reproducibility. After setting our working directory, we imported the files into dataframes for better transformation capabilities.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># set relative brewery file path as variable
beers_csv &lt;- here(&quot;project_files&quot;, &quot;Beers.csv&quot;)
breweries_csv &lt;- here(&quot;project_files&quot;, &quot;Breweries.csv&quot;)

# initialize dataframes
beers &lt;- data.frame(read.csv(beers_csv))
breweries &lt;- data.frame(read.csv(breweries_csv))</code></pre>

<div id="part-1-counting-breweries-by-state." class="section level1">
<h1>Part 1: Counting breweries by state.</h1>
<p>How many breweries are present in each state? In order to investigate the number of breweries in our data set, we group everything by state and then perform a tally function in order to count total breweries. Then we plot the results as a bar chart using ggplot (and plotly).</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Question 1 - How many breweries are present in each state?
per_state &lt;- breweries %&gt;% group_by(State) %&gt;% tally(name=&quot;breweries_per_state&quot;) %&gt;% arrange(desc(breweries_per_state))

 # Part 2: Joining beer and brewery datasets. Can we combine the data? What’s it look like? In order to join the two dataframes, we called the “merge” function and joined the two dataframes on common keys - brewery_id and brew_id. We made sure to rename the columns for easier reuse and then displayed the results using an rbind function to combine the heads and tails of the resultant dataframe.</p>

<h1>Part 3: Addressing “NA” values.</h1>
<p>How can we address the “NA” values? In order to perform more detailed analysis, it’s important to address the null values. In order to get a better idea of missing data, we filtered the dataframe to only null values using “is.na” and then took the count of each column using “colSums”. You can see in the print statement below that the most influencial null value is ibu. Almost half of the ibu values are missing! In order to “massage” this into workable data, we made an assumption that the median values for each style should be fairly close to the actual values. This is due to the fact that each beer style has ranges on ibu, therefore, we know a good range of potential values which the actual could lie in.</p>
